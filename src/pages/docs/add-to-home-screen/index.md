Hyperspace is available to all kinds of devices through the web and official desktop apps. While we aren't able to deliver mobile apps ready for the App Store or Play Store, Hyperspace users can still enjoy Hyperspace on their mobile device by adding it as a progressive web app.

# What is a progressive web app?

A progressive web app (PWA) uses the power and extensibility of the web to provide an experience like an app without needing to download it first from the App Store or Play Store. PWA are meant to be fast, reliable, and enaging, and we hope Hyperspace fits these needs.

# Install Hyperspace as a PWA

## iOS
On your iPhone or iPad, open the Hyperspace instance you want to add as a PWA in Safari.

Hyperspace should now appear on your home screen. Tap the icon to use Hyperspace.

## Android
Instructions for Android may vary depending on the browser installed on your phone. Adding the app to your home screen should be avialable in the setting's menu as 'Add shortcut' or 'Add to home screen'. Though we cannot cover for all browsers, here is how you can manually do it in Chrome.

1. Open the Hyperspace site in Chrome.
2. Tap the Settings icon (three dots) and select 'Add to Home screen'.
3. Tap 'Add' on the dialog.

Hyperspace should now appear on your home screen. Tap the icon to use Hyperspace.

> Note: Depending on your browser or Hyperspace's configuration, you might be asked automatically to add the icon to your home screen.
